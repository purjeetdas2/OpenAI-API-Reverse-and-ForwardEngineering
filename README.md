## Overview

This project leverages Python and the OpenAI API to:
- Conduct reverse engineering of mainframe code (e.g., JCL, COBOL)
- Translate and transform legacy code into modern frameworks
- Allow business rule extraction and code analysis for modern application development

## Features

- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyze and revert compiled mainframe code into a human-readable format.
- **Forward Engineering**: Translate legacy code into modern programming languages and frameworks.
- **API Integration**: Utilize the OpenAI API for natural language processing to assist in code understanding and transformation.
